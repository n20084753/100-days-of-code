# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library started with linked list implementation ES6

**Thoughts:** I have used STL like Vectors, Maps, Sets in c++ i know they exist in native javascript but I like to explore and build my own STL library in javascript also learn ES6 along the way.

**Link to work:** [STL.js](https://github.com/n20084753/STL.js)

### Day 1: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library made progress and implemented linked list and stack ADT's

**Link to work:** [STL.js](https://github.com/n20084753/STL.js)

### Day 2: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library made some interesting progress in learning and implementing Queue and Set ADT's

**Tomorrow's Plan**: 
1. Include Array implentation of Stack and Queue by which i can make the access by index faster
2. Plaining to implement Dictonary / hash table and move on to non linear data structure linke tress

**Link to work:** [STL.js](https://github.com/n20084753/STL.js)

### Day 3: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library Not as productive as expected had lot of learning on hash tables implemented Dictionary and basic HashTable implementation

**Tomorrow's Plan**: 
1. Include Array implentation of Stack and Queue by which i can make the access by index faster
2. Fixing collision in hash tables and move on to non linear data structure linke tress 

**Link to work:** [STL.js](https://github.com/n20084753/STL.js)

### Day 4: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library Another lazy day implemented fixing collision in hash tables and learned Binary search tree

**Tomorrow's Plan**: 
1. Include Array implentation of Stack and Queue by which i can make the access by index faster
2. Implement Binary search tree

**Link to work:** [STL.js](https://github.com/n20084753/STL.js)

### Day 5: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library - Landed from linear to non-linear territory of data structure had fun learning and implementing.

**Tomorrow's Plan**: Fixing the problem in binary search tree that is balance the tree when they are getting skewed at one side.

**Link to work:** [STL.js](https://github.com/n20084753/STL.js)

### Day 6: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library - AVL Tree what a beautiful piece of work from two great mathematicians Adelson-Velsky and Landis to balance the Binary search tree and make sure that all operations cost only O(log n). Had super fun learning and implementing them.

**Tomorrow's Plan**: Try my hands on red black tree which is almost similar to AVL trees for balancing binary search tree.
