### Day 0: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: STL.js library started with linked list implementation ES6

**Thoughts:** I have used STL like Vectors, Maps, Sets in c++ i know they exist in native javascript but I like to explore and build my own STL library in javascript also learn ES6 along the way.
